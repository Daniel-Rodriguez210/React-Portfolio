# React-Portfolio

I have created a portfolio utilizing react for the front end of the website. 

Technologies utilized are React, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node. 

I wanted to be able to show that I can create a portfolio using a more widespread library such as react. 

I was able to get the website looking the way I wanted for the most part, but still want to improve. 

I am currently working on a project "Bubble Thought" that I will include. 

Also, I wasn't able to get the submission card working to correspond with my email.
